This repository contains a software delivery machine (SDM) for
deploying applications to Kubernetes using the [Atomist][atomist] API.
Currently, deploying Docker images as deployments with optional
services and ingress rules is supported.

Software delivery machines enable you to control your delivery process
in code.  Think of it as an API for your software delivery.  See the
[Atomist documentation][atomist-doc] for more information on the
concept of a software delivery machine and how to create and develop
an SDM.
